# Seal Stranding Data MACS 401 FINAL PROJECT

Max Ignatyev - Winter 2023

### Project Objectives

- Visualize harbor seal stranding data in Washington State
- Analyze patterns in stranding data
- Consider how this data can be usefull

### Background

Harbor seal strandings occur when a seal is found (usually on a beach) for a reason outside of normal behavior such as hauling out. Most stranding events typically involve the animal being dead. In Washington state there is a collection of stranding response agencies that respond to stranding events and report these to NOAA.

### Data

Washington State Marine Mammal Stranding Data was obtained by request from NOAA. Dataset used in this project is a trimmed version of that datafile.

[Seal Data]("SealDataTime.csv")

### Methods

Data processing and analysis done in python using pandas and matplotlib.
Data visualization with time series done in qGIS.

### Conclusions

Stranding events seem to correlate with breeding season patterns in the Puget Sound. It would be interesting to study how much human disturbance relates to stranding locations, and figure out how to differential specific anthropogenic disturbance vs something like sample bias where more populated areas may tend to have more stranding reports.
